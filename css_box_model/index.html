    <h1>CSS Box Model</h1>
    <div class="margin_color">
        <p class="box">content</p>
        <p class="box">content</p>
    </div>

    <p>Every element in css is a box</p>
    <p>And each box consists of 4 parts</p>
    <p>Content - Red</p>
    <p>Padding - Yellow</p>
    <p>Border - Grren</p>
    <p>Margin - Blue</p>

    <p>In the above example there is two boxes labeled "content" in red</p>
    <p>The padding which is yellow, is part of the background of the content and is the area inside the border which is green in the example above</p>
    <p>The green outline that sorrounds the content and the padding is the border</p>
    <p>And lastly the blue signifies the margin, which is the space sorounding the box/elements</p>

    <p>Margin collapses between elements that share margin between eachother. And the shared side of the element with the higher margin is applied as the margin between elements</p>
    <p>Setting the box-sizing style to border box makes it so that the elements height and width is exacly as specified</p>
